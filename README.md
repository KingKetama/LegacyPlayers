## LegacyPlayers
LegacyPlayers is a community driven project to establish a platform where people
playing on all kind of expansions of World of Warcraft can share raid logs, PvP logs
and armory data. It aims to persist all data of all coming and going private servers,
as well as to provide easy access to them.

With this repository we are aiming to reboot LegacyPlayers for the Private Server Community.
